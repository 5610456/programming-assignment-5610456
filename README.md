Using John Macey ParticleQt as a reference, replacing 'Particle' with 'Boid' and 'Emitter' with 'Flock'

#Introduction



# Background Research
-
About Boids:

Defined by a computer scientist within the 1980s, Craig Reynolds who developed the algorithm.

  They follow three rules:
    1) Cohesion- Moving towards a large population of other boids, keeping within the crowd.
    2) Separation- Avoid colliding with other boids, keeping to a clear path.
    3) Alignment- Maintain the same direction as the rest of the boids.


# Design and Structure
-
Within my program the classes are as follows:
  >Boid
  >Flock
  >NGLScene
  >MainWindow
